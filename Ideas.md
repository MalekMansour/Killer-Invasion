IDEA SUMMARY UPDATED (2024-06-18)

I. Story
- The game is set in a dangerous neighborhood at night. The main characther lives inside a house. The environment is grainy, gloomy, and somewhat terrifying. 
Your son has been kidnapped and the kidnappers are asking for 300 crypto coins in return. You decide to go back to the old ways that you used to make money, which is on the dark web. There are two ways you can win.
  1) Trying to get the money from hacking / crypto mining / gambling. 
  2) Try to find the location of the kidnapper on the dark web and get to kill the guy, and save your son.
- You would also have to defend yourself against a killer that might find your IP and your address and you have to hide/close the lights etc. The police can also find you if you are doing a lot of dangerous things on the dark web. 
Players should get good instructions at the beginning. The game should be challenging but not to the point where it is unbeatable.
The game will start by providing a 3 step guide (Kinda mocking how "easy" the game is.) The 3 step guide will explain some basic mechanics but not all. The 3 step guide will also provide some basic images. 

3 Step Guide:
1. Turn on all the lights to keep your sanity.
2. Hack people to make money.
3. Look out the windows. Hide if you feel in danger.

II. Mechanics

1. Sanity Level
- There is an Insanity Level (hidden from the player)
- Keeping 4 lights on will decrease Insanity Fast. 3 lights on will decrease Isanity slow. 2 lights on wont do anything to Insanity. 1 light on will increase insanity fast. 0 lights on will rapidly increase the insanity.

- There is 8 cigarettes in the kitchen. Each cigarette smoked will decrease the insanity by 20%.
- There is an infinite amount of pills to take. Each pill decrease the insanity by 5%. If too many pills are taken at the same time, some side effects might start happening and the insanity might start increasing instead. 
- Level 0 - Level 1: 20%. Level 1 - Level 2: 40%. Level 2 - Level 3: 60%. Level 3 - Level 4: 80%. Level 4 - Level 5: 100% = Death.
- Hallucination: where the insanity is too high. The player will constantly see random stuff (lost items/shadows lurking behind/knocking/slamming/whistle/screaming/police siren/weird noises/laughing sounds/lights flickering/etc)

2. Exposure Level: Will be shown on the laptop screen. It is the skull signal that illustrates how exposed the player is to the internet. Each website has an exposure value.
- The Skull Icon will go from white, to yellow, to red. Only red indicates that the exposure level is increasing.
- The Exposure Level calculated in percentages % will be hidden from the player. Once the Exposure level hits 100%, the police will come to the player's house and start their attack.
- Value 0 = no exposure increase.
- Value 1 = Slow Exposure Increase. (The longer you stay on the website, the more the exposure level increases.) 
- Value 2 = Fast Exposure Increase. (Faster Increase.)
- Value 3 = Semi-Instant Exposure Increase. (Will start from Yellow Skull and slowly go up and turn into red.)
- Value 4 = Instant Exposure Increase. (Will start from the Red Skull.)

4. Killer
- The killers might appear in front of the door/outside the window/etc.
- The player can use sound cues (e.g. footsteps in the garden) or visual cues (e.g. door peephole, window blinds) to detect nearby killers.
- Players can hide under the bed.
- 4 lights on = 12 - 16 Minutes to leave. 3 Lights on = 8 - 12 Minutes to leave. 2 Lights on = 4 - 8 Minutes to leave. 1 Light on = 2 - 4 Minutes to leave. 0 Lights on = 1 - 2 Minutes to leave.
  
5. Police:
- If the insanity level reaches 100%, the police will come for you in the next 5 - 25 minutes. There is no way of surviving the police if they come to your house.
  
6. Ambience:
  - Cars driving by, owl, dog barking, etc.
    
7. Gamble:
- If you are really desperate to get money, you can gamble online. You can play blackjack.
- The more the player bets, the less chance he has of winning.
