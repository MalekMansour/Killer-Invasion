MEETING SUMMARY (03/24/2024)

I. Story
The game is placed in an unknown place. The main character lives inside a house. The environment is grainy, gloomy, and somewhat terrifying. 
Your son has been kidnapped and the kidnappers are asking for 300 crypto coins in return. You decide to go back to the old ways that you used to make money, which is on the dark web. There are two ways you can win.
  1) Trying to get the money from crypto mining / having a scam website / doing favors for other people. 
  2) Try to find the location of the kidnapper on the dark web and get to "kill" the guy, and save your son.
You would also have to defend yourself against various killers that might find your IP and your address and you have to hide/close the lights etc. The police can also find you if you are doing a lot of dangerous things on the dark web. 
There will be multiple endings to the game. (father saves son/father ditches son/etc)
Players should get good instructions at the beginning. The game should be challenging but not to the point where it is unbeatable.

II. Mechanics
1. Sanity Level
- You might also become more insane the more you visit websites. So you have to smoke cigarettes (maybe 8 max) or take pills (infinite but the insanity level will be much harder to control if the player takes too much) to help decrease it.
- Hallucination: where the insanity is too high. The player will constantly see random stuff (lost items/shadows lurking behind/knocking/slamming/whistle/screaming/police siren/weird noises/laughing sounds/lights flickering/etc)
2. Danger level: will be shown on the laptop screen. It is the signal that illustrates how exposed the player is to the internet. The higher it is, the higher the chance the player will be found by killers/police.
3. Black market:
4. Killer
- The killers might appear in front of the door/outside the window/etc.
- The player can use sound cues (e.g. footsteps in the garden) or visual cues (e.g. door peephole, window blinds) to detect nearby killers.
- Players can hide in the closet, washroom, or under the bed.
- Turn off all the lights before hiding.
5. Police:
- Sound cues: police siren
- If you hear police sirens but there is nothing outside the window --> Hallucination. If you hear police sirens and there are police cars outside the window --> The police are coming --> Log out of the dark web, turn off all the lights, and hide.
6. Ambience:
7. Gamble:
- If you are really desperate to get money, you can gamble online. You can either do blackjack or roulette.
- The gambling website will be rigged. 
- Cars/motorbikes driving by, owl, dog barking, etc.
8. Lights:
- The player has to keep the light open (most of the time) because if the house is too dark, the insanity level will go up much faster.
- There are 4 light switches in the house. When you hide from the killer/police, you have to turn off all the lights. The more lights are turned on, the higher the chance you will get caught in your hiding place.
