MEETING SUMMARY (03/24/2024)

I. Story
- The game is set in a dangerous neighborhood. The main characther lives inside a house. The environment is grainy, gloomy, and somewhat terrifying. 
Your son has been kidnapped and the kidnappers are asking for 300 crypto coins in return. You decide to go back to the old ways that you used to make money, which is on the dark web. There are two ways you can win.
  1) Trying to get the money from crypto mining / doing favors for other people / gambling. 
  2) Try to find the location of the kidnapper on the dark web and get to "kill" the guy, and save your son.
- You would also have to defend yourself against various killers that might find your IP and your address and you have to hide/close the lights etc. The police can also find you if you are doing a lot of dangerous things on the dark web. 
There will be multiple endings to the game. (father saves son/father ditches son/etc)
Players should get good instructions at the beginning. The game should be challenging but not to the point where it is unbeatable.
The game will start by providing a 3 step guide (Kinda mocking how "easy" the game is.) The 3 step guide will explain some basic mechanics but not all. The 3 step guide will also provide some basic images. 

3 Step Guide:
1. Turn on all the lights to keep your sanity.
2. Browse the Dark Web & find ways to make money.
3. Look out the windows. Hide if you feel in danger.

II. Mechanics
1. Sanity Level
- There is an Insanity Level (hidden from the player)
- Keeping 4 lights on will decreased Insanity. 3 lights on will not change anything. 2 lights on will increase insanity. 1 light on will increase insanity. 0 lights on will rapidly increase the insanity.
- Each website will have a specific sanity value. The higher the value is, the more % the insanity will increase.
- There is 8 cigarettes in the kitchen. Each cigarette smoked will decrease the insanity by 20%.
- There is an infinite amount of pills to take. Each pill decrease the insanity by 5%. If too many pills are taken at the same time, some side effects might start happening and the insanity might start increasing instead. 
- Level 0 - Level 1: 20%. Level 1 - Level 2: 40%. Level 2 - Level 3: 60%. Level 3 - Level 4: 80%. Level 4 - Level 5: 100% = Death.
- Hallucination: where the insanity is too high. The player will constantly see random stuff (lost items/shadows lurking behind/knocking/slamming/whistle/screaming/police siren/weird noises/laughing sounds/lights flickering/etc)

2. Exposure Level: Will be shown on the laptop screen. It is the signal that illustrates how exposed the player is to the internet. Each website has an exposure value.
- The Skull Icon will go from white, to yellow, to red. Only red indicates that the exposure level is increasing.
- The Exposure Level calculated in percentages % will be hidden from the player. Once the Exposure level hits 100%, the police will come to the player's house and start their attack.
- Value 0 = no exposure increase.
- Value 1 = Slow Exposure Increase. (The longer you stay on the website, the more the exposure level increases.) 
- Value 2 = Fast Exposure Increase. (Faster Increase.)
- Value 3 = Semi-Instant Exposure Increase. (Will start from Yellow Skull and slowly go up.)
- Value 4 = Instant Exposure Increase. (Will start from the Red Skull.)
  
3. Black market:

4. Killer
-  
- The killers might appear in front of the door/outside the window/etc.
- The player can use sound cues (e.g. footsteps in the garden) or visual cues (e.g. door peephole, window blinds) to detect nearby killers.
- Players can hide in the closet, washroom, or under the bed.
- Turn off all the lights before hiding.
5. Police:
- Sound cues: police siren
- If you hear police sirens but there is nothing outside the window --> Hallucination. If you hear police sirens and there are police cars outside the window --> The police are coming --> Log out of the dark web, turn off all the lights, and hide.
6. Ambience:
  - Cars/motorbikes driving by, owl, dog barking, etc.
7. Gamble:
- If you are really desperate to get money, you can gamble online. You can either do blackjack or roulette.
- The blackjack will be rigged to always make the player loser.
- The roulette game has a 20% of making the player win.
8. Lights:
- The player has to keep the light open (most of the time) because if the house is too dark, the insanity level will go up much faster.
- There are 4 light switches in the house. When you hide from the killer/police, you have to turn off all the lights. The more lights are turned on, the higher the chance you will get caught in your hiding place.
