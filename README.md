# Killer Invasion
Your son has been kidnapped and they are asking for 300 crypto coins in return. You decide to go back to the old ways that you used to make money, which is on the dark web. There is two ways you can win. 
1) Trying to get the money from crypto mining / having a scam website / doing favors for other ppl. 
2) Try to find the location of the kidnapper on the dark web and get to "kill" the guy.
You would also have to defend yourself against various killers that might find your ip and your address and you have to hide/close the lights etc. The police can also find you if you are doing a lot of dangerous things on the dark web. You might also become more insane the more you visit websites. So maybe you have to sleep (which skips time but decreases sanity) or maybe other things can also help decrease it.
